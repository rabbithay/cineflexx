## About

Cineflex is a web application designed to reserve seats in a cinema.

You can choose the movie you want to watch and the session time you prefer. When choosing the session, you will see the list and arrangement of seats, organized by color between available and unavailable.

It is not allowed to select unavailable seats. After selecting the seats you want, you need to fill in your personal information before proceeding to the next page.

Your reservation's review page will list the seats you've chosen and your personal information you've provided, which you'll need to show to confirm your identity when you go to see the movie.

Good movie session!

(the app was designed for mobile, for a better experience, access from a cell phone)
